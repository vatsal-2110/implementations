# implementations
this repository contains implementations :
## 1) MLP for character level language model name prediction:
This is a MLP inspired by Andrej Karpathy's makemore second video, in which he built a MLP. This is a similar implemetation of that where i have tried some of the exercise mentioned in the description.

## 2) trigram_character_level_language_model :
This is a character-level model inspired by Andrej Karpathy's makemore first video, in which he implemented a bigram model. This is a modified version of that in which I have implemented a trigram model based on similar architecture
