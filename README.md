# implementations
this repository contains implementations :
## 1) MLP for character level language model name prediction:
This is a MLP inspired by Andrej Karpathy's makemore second video, in which he built a MLP. This is a similar implemetation of that where i have tried some of the exercise mentioned in the description.

## 2) trigram_character_level_language_model :
This is a character-level model inspired by Andrej Karpathy's makemore first video, in which he implemented a bigram model. This is a modified version of that in which I have implemented a trigram model based on similar architecture

## 3) activation and batchnorm :
This is pytorchifying MLP along with several updates that make training neural networks easier like batch normilazation and it also have various tolls for activation and gradient inspection. this is inspired by Andrej Karpathy's makemore third video. it also has some experiments like zero init of weights and folding batchnorm layer weights into previous layer
